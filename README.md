# `Webpack Guide`

_The project consists of doing the following:_

_1.-Creating a package.json file and installing its dependencies._

_2.-Creating a bundle and multiple bundles._

_3.-Creating a webpack.config.js._

_4.-Transpilating the code with Babel._

_5.-Updating the changes with Webpack(watch)._

_6.-Import CSS and SCSS with Javascript with Webpack._

_7.-Adding common Chunks to create a file with common code._

_8.-Adding webpack-dev-server to the project._

_9.-Webpack to create the HTML._


_Dynamic JS Code with modules through Webpack._


## Settings 🔧

_Installating **Node.js** with NPM (https://nodejs.org/es/)._


_You must use this scripts to create the dependecies:_

* **npm init** - _(To create a package.json file.)_


_You must use this scripts to create the dependecies:_

* **npm install --save-dev** - _(To create a webpack dependency.)_

* **npm install --save-dev webpack-cli** - _(To create a command line interface webpack dependency.)_

* **npm install --save-dev @babel/cli @babel/core @babel/preset-env @babel/register babel-loader** - <br />
 _(To create a Babel dependencies.)_

* **npm install --save-dev style-loader css-loader** - _(To create a CSS dependencies.)_

* **npm install --save-dev sass-loader** - _(To create a Sass dependency.)_

* **npm install --save-dev node-sass** - _(To create a Sass dependency.)_

* **npm install -g --unsafe-perm node-sass --save** - _(To create a Sass dependency the global way.)_

* **npm install --save-dev webpack-dev-server** - _(To create a Server dependency.)_

* **npm install --save-dev html-webpack-plugin** - _(To create the HTML plugin dependency, which <br />
  automatically puts the HTML files inside the packages folder)_

**Nota:** <br />
In Linux it is necessary to sometimes putting the term **sudo** in front to  the script to authenticate yourself, <br />
and thus be able to install the dependencies.


_You must use this scripts to run the project:._

* **npm install** - _(To install the dependencies that have been created in the package.json file.)_

* **npm run build** - _(To create or updating the Webpack bundles.)_

* **npm run dev** - _(To run the server. To exit the server press Ctrl+C.)_
